		<p>Dark Souls 3 won many awards such as the Golden Joystick and also the steam award for a huge hate-love relationship.
		<br> It also won the GOTY(2016)Award from IGN and the Gamescom-Award for the best action RPG.
		</p>
		<p>One of the most famous critic-sites <b>"metacritics"</b> gave the game a metascore of <b>89</b> which is pretty impressive if you ask me.
		</p>
		
		<h2 class="facts">Personal opinion:</h2>
		
		<p>My personal opinion on the game is pretty close to the metacritic score. The game is an adventure that needs to be experienced if you wanna call yourself a gamer. 
		<br>There are only some small bugs in the game and the mechanics feel insanely smooth.
		</p>
		<p>But most importantly the music... The music is crazy... crazyly good. It fits every moment. Fighting or exploring, a track 
		<br>that fits the emotions is always by your side.
		</p>
		<p>This "Souls"-game is also the last of the series which is a good decision. TheyÂ´re finishing a great series with an
		<br>absolute <b>masterpiece</b>.
