		<h1 id="C1"> Iudex Gundyr </h1>
		<br> <img class="bosspic" src="../pics/iudex.jpg">
		<h2 class="facts">		Difficulty: </h2>
		
		<p>	We need to look from two perspectives now.
			<br> 	The boss itself isn´t hard if you played the game in advance. 
			<br>	But most people actually started with DS3.
			<br>	This fact makes the boss actually really hard, which also lead me to tilt a few times.
		</p>
		<h2 class="facts">	Information about the fight:</h2>
			<p>		This boss must be beaten in two different phases. After taking half of his HP
			<br>	Gundyr	will halfly transform into a black monstrosity that will probably leave you speechless. This changes his attacks and makes him way more deadly than before.
			<br>	Gundyr has a small moveset which will be in your favour. Learning his attacks won´t take that long.
			</p>
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
		<h1 id="C2"> Vordt of the Boreal Valley </h1>
		<br> <img class="bosspic"src="../pics/vordt.jpg">
		<h2 class="facts">		Difficulty: </h2>
		
		<p>	Vordt is one of the easiest bosses in DS3.
			<br>To my mind Vordt even feels easier than Gundyr.
		</p>
		<h2 class="facts">	Information about the fight:</h2>
		<p>  If you follow one single tip Vordt will be easily defeated. 
			<br>Try to stick on his back. If you follow this simple trick Vordt wont be able to hit you with his abilities. 
			<br> During the fight when Vordt peakes low HP he screams insanely loud and gets surrounded by an icy aura.
			<br> He then starts to run around the room targeting you. 
			<br> Your only chance to attack is, when he starts channeling his ice breath.You should be able to finish him after two ice breaths.
		</p>
			
			
			
			
			
			
			
			<h1 id="C3"> Crystal Sage</h1>
		<br> <img class="bosspic" src="../pics/crystal.jpg">
		<h2 class="facts">		Difficulty: </h2>
		
		<p>	 The boss itself isn´t very challenging due to his low HP. Tho the burst damage of the boss is really impressive.
			<br> If you manage to play careful the boss will be done after a few trys.	
		</p>
		<h2 class="facts">	Information about the fight:</h2>
		<p>	Crystal Sage, as the name already tells, is a magician. As you strike into battle the Zorro-looking mage will cast
			<br> homing ice missiles that follow you wherever you go but if you stay behind a wall the missile will pop and wont longer bober you.
			<br> In the second phase he creates white-eyed duplicates. 
			<br> If you manage to find the real one with the purple glowing ones and nuke him down fastly you´re good.
			
			
			
			
					<h1 id="C4"> The Abyss Watchers</h1>
		<br> <img class="bosspic" src="../pics/abyss.jpg">
		<h2 class="facts">		Difficulty: </h2>
		
		<p>	 So, now we talk about the most stylish and impressing boss featured in this game. That´s why im going more into detail now.
			<br> The boss is probably the first challenge to new Dark Souls players because mastering this boy wont be that easy.
			<br> He has a varied moveset which can/will kill you if you don´t exactly know what his next move is.
			<br> The key to mastering this boss is definitly taking time in learning his moveset.
			<br> But even then the boss can one-shot-kill you if you manage to miss dotching one of his attacks. Can be tilting. Really tilting.
		</p>
			
		<p> <img class="bosspic" src="../pics/abyss2.jpg">
			
			
		</p>
		<h2 class="facts">	Information about the fight:</h2>
		<p>	 The fight is a little different than others. After fighting a few seconds a second Abyss Watcher will join the fight and attack you.  	
			<br> A few seconds after the first one jumped in a third one comes into play. 
			<br>The third one is marked with red shining eyes and will be your best friend (if you dont attack him). He targets the main boss and his friend along you.
			<br> After getting the HP down to 0 at first the boss will respawn and completly change his moveset. 
			<br>Impressivly he respawns with an aura of fire surrounding his sword and a slight touch of ember on his clothes
			<br> which creates an insane atmosphere during the boss fight. The music that is played also is just awesome.
			
			
			
			<h1 id="C5"> Deacons of the Deep and Wolnir</h1>
		<p> Meet the Deacons of the Deep
		<br> <img class="bosspic" src="../pics/deacons.jpg"> 
		<p> Lord Wolnir of Carthus
		<br>	<img class="bosspic" src="../pics/wolnir.png"> 
		<h2 class="facts">		Difficulty: </h2>
		
		<p>	 Don´t worry, you won´t have a hard time on these two, they´re pretty weak. 
		<br>Even without knowing what the boss does you	can probably defeat him in two or three attempts.
		</p>
		<h2 class="facts">	Information about the fights:</h2>
		<p>	After beating <a href="#C3">Crystal Sage</a> and <a href="#C4">The Abyss Watchers</a> you can now choose how you proceed. 
			<br> The best way would be to take down the Deacons first because they drop you an item that is needed to continue after defeating Wolnir.
			<p> <b>Deacons:</b>
			<br>The Deacons are just a lot of undead priests that want to take your soul. Sounds scary but dont worry if you´re not unlucky the boss won´t be a problem to you.
			<br>You can get trapped inside a huge mass of those Undeads but even then you can roll your way out. 
			<br>The fight also contains two phases.(as actually many bosses do) In phase one a flame will drop onto one of many priests that will then be marked with an aura of fire.
			<br>The HP of the boss will only drop if you hunt the priest marked with the flame. And yea it´s as easy as it sounds.
			<br>On phase two a high-priest joins the battle. Dont worry he isn´t really able to fight back harder than the other priests. Just hunt him next an the item of your behave is yours.
			<br> <b>Wolnir:</b>
			<br> This spooky scary skeleton is also no challenge. Hit his huge yellow sparkling braceletts and the victory will be yours.
			<br> If you get unlucky the boss will glitch you into darkness while hitting his left bracelett. But dont get tilted just try again.
			
			
			
			<h1 id="C6"> Pontiff Sulyvahn</h1>
		<br> <img class="bosspic" src="../pics/pontiff.png">
		<h2 class="factspontiff">		Difficulty and Information: </h2>
		<p>	 After reading the introduction of my site you may think "why is the game so hard when the first bosses are defeated so easily"? Well here comes the answer.
			<br> Pontiff will be your first challenge in DS3. To my mind Pontiff is the hardest boss in DS3. I personally stopped playing for several months because	
			<br> I couldn´t proceed from this point on. That´s why im going to tell you now how I took him down my first time.
		</p>
		<p> He mainly deals fire and magic damage. You should equip a light armor that lets you move fast and has a high resistance against fire and magic.(obviously) 
		</p>
		<h2 class="facts">		Tactic: </h2>
		<p>  I personally played the fight with a shield tactic. Professional players would use a technique that is called parrying where you counter his attacks but this takes
			<br> a damn lot of practice because the timing is really hard. My tactic is for beginners.
		</p>
		<p>	 Equip the best shield you have at this point of the game and a fast one-handed weapon. Use your shield to block and walk around the boss while blocking.
			<br> Time after time Sulyvahn will do a charge-attack that won´t hit you if you keep walking around him. 
			<br>After his attack there is a small period of time where you can drop your defensive position and attack him 2 times. 
			<br>Do this until he joins phase 2. This is where the real pain begins.
		</p> 
		<p> During second phase his attack do more damage are performed faster and time after time he spawns a clone of himself that mirrors his attacks with low HP but the same power as Pontiff himself.
			<br> While he spawns his clone he´s vulnerable so be sure to drop a lot of damage on him AND also his clone. 
			<br>After that, tryhard as hard as you can and take down the clone because you won´t be able to take down the boss if you get hunted by duplicated attacks.
			<br> Then pray and use your shield but be aware of the attacks that can´t be blocked.(all magic attacks, you will notice them)
		</p>
		<h2 class="facts">		Best regards </h2>
		<p> I wish you all the luck that I can give you. Take your time! Some feel good after they defeat the boss. 
		<br>Some scream really loudly filled with anger on the game.(definitly not me)
		<br> Hate-love relationship. As I said. After feeling this you´ll instantly fall in love with the game.
		</p>
		
		
		
		
		
		
			<h1 id="C11"> Yhorm the Giant</h1>
		<br> <img class="bosspic" src="../pics/yhorm.jpg">
		<h2 class="facts">		Difficulty: </h2>
		<p>	No problem, trust me.
		</p>
		<h2 class="facts">	Information about the fight:</h2>
		<p>	As you walk into a huge room you´ll see Yhorm walking to you fastly. 
		<br>I had no idea how to get this boss done and just tried the rutine. Damaging him.
		<br>It did no damage at all and of course you´re not supposed to kill Yhorm with a normal sword.
		</p>
		<p>If you run to his huge throne you will find "The Storm Ruler" which is a double-handed sword. 
		<br>If you charge the sword long enough you can channel a huge air slash which deals a dramandous amount
		<br>of damage.
		
		
		
		<h1 id="C7"> The Devourer of Gods, Aldrich </h1>
		<br> <img class="bosspic" src="../pics/aldrich.jpg">
		<h2 class="facts">		Difficulty: </h2>
		
		<p> Aldrich is a boss that is as tilting as Sulyvahn. Simply because he can oneshot you with one of his attacks.	
		<br> This well known attack where he shoots arrows at you can only be dotched by praying or hiding behind a pillar. 
		<br>The sad thing is that Aldrich destroys those pillars time after time. 
		<br>So you got a limited time to take him to his second phase where you can finally run away from his arrow-attack.	
		<br> Quick reminder : His tail takes more damage than his body so makes sure to hit his tail.
		</p>
		<h2 class="facts">	Information about the fight:</h2>
		<p>	This weird looking snake-/human-thingy will be met just a few minutes ahead from Sulyvahn. 
		<br>Yea, two insane bosses in a row. Thats DS3.		
		</p>
		
		
		
		
			<h1 id="C8"> Dancer of the Boreal Valley</h1>
		<br> <img class="bosspic" src="../pics/dancer.jpg">
		<h2 class="facts">		Difficulty: </h2>
		
		<p> Many say "The Dancer is cancer" and actually thats kinda true. His attacks are fast and hit like a truck.
		<br>On his second phase he pulls a sword out of the ground and is then able to perfom an attack that lets him spin	
		<br>like a fidget spinner. Be sure to stay away because this attack will probably one-shot you.
		</p>
		<p> He also deals magic and fire damage just as <a href="#C6">Pontiff</a> does so be sure to equip
		<br>light armor with high magic and fire resistance.
		</p>
		<h2 class="facts">	Information about the fight:</h2>
		<p> He starts with one sword but will continue with two after loosing half of his HP. You need to make sure to
		<br> dotch his grap-attack which will be noticeable. It doesnt seem very devastating because of the slow animation
		<br> but it will get you dont to 1/4 of your HP so be careful.
		<br> Sadly I can´t give many tips for this fight because it is based on learning his moveset. 
		</p>
		<p>Dont give up too early you´ll get it done.
		</p>
		
		
		<h1 id="C9"> Lorian, Elder Prince </h1>
		<br> <img class="bosspic" src="../pics/lorian.jpg">
		<h2 class="facts">		Difficulty: </h2>
		
		<p> Lorian can be hit-traded very well because you´ll have enough heal power at this stage of the game.
		<br> This makes his first phase pretty easy if you manage to dotch his knock-up.
		<br> In phase 2 you need to fight two enemies. Him and his brother. It is important to know that the fight will
		<br> end only if you manage to take down the brother that lays upon the princes shoulder. If you do it the other way around
		<br> he will be revived.
		</p>
		<h2 class="facts">	Information about the fight:</h2>
		<p>	Lorian always fascinated me because of the unique fighting style and his design ingeneral. It seems like his Lorian, the Elder Prince
		<br>is controlled by his younger brother. Ingeneral the boss seems well designed all-around.
		</p>
		<p>That doesn´t make the fight easier tho. The attack of this boss deal a lot of damage and he teleports behind you a lot.
		<br>Phase 1 still isn´t compareable to phase 2 where you face Lorian and his brother together. They both have seperate HP.
		<br>His sword will also have a little upgrade. He deals way more damage and the magic attacks of his brother are deadly aswell.
		<br>Always be aware of the situation you´re in and dotch his strong teleport attacks.
		</p>
		<p> After beating this boss the game still isn´t over. You killed all necessary bosses but there´s still one left.
		</p>
		
		
		
		<h1 id="C10"> Soul of Cinder, your final challenge</h1>
		<br> <img class="bosspic" src="../pics/cinder.jpg">
		<h2 class="facts">		Difficulty: </h2>
		
		<p> This boss is worthy of beeing the end-boss of this game series.
		</p>
		<p> He features one of the hardest and longest fights in the game and features the power of all bosses you defeated during your journey.
		<br>This boss can bring you to frustration more than one time but it will be worth beating him, trust me. 
		</p>
		<p>Keeping distance and waiting for his leeping attack is a good way of avoiding damage in the first phase.
		<br>Because he can switch between 4 forms (sorcery,miracle,pyromancy and melee) his moveset is imense but still needed to learn.
		<br>The bad thing is that not every form provides a good and easily counterable attack. 
		<br>His sorcery form is the worst in my opinion because he deals an insane amount of damage if you dont manage to dotch the spells he casts.
		</p>
		<p>As much as I wanted to help you trough this fight I wont help you on this one. You´re on your own. Good luck! 
		</p>
		<h2 class="facts">	Information about the fight:</h2>
		<p>	The music and the enviroment share the fact that you´re facing the end-boss of a game that led me and probably others trough a lot of hate but also love on the game.
		</p>
		<p>From leeping-attacks to huge fire explosions and lightning bolts everything is thrown at you this fight. But there are no clones, atleast something.
		<br>As said before the boss features 4 different forms. 
		<h2 class="facts"> Pyromancy form </h2>
		<p> he holds a curved sword and will be faster than in any other form
		</p>
		<h2 class="facts"> Sorcery form </h2>
		<p> he is holding a staff and his attacks will deal a massive amount of damage to you
		</p>
		<h2 class="facts"> Miracle form </h2>
		<p> gives him a pike which grants him a huge range
		</p>
		<h2 class="facts"> Melee form </h2>
		<p>noticeable by his longsword that lets him perfom a devastating combo-attack. 
		<br>You dont wanna get hit by that or you´re in trouble.
		</p>
