		</div> 
		<div class="first">
		<p> Dark Souls is a RPG (Roll-Play-Game) that is on the market since 2011. 
		<br>It´s one of many games which count to the "Souls"-series. It contains three parts which are all based on one huge lore. </p>
		<ul><p>Timeline of releases</p>
		<li>2009	Demon's Souls</li>
		<li>2011	Dark Souls</li>
		<li>2014	Dark Souls II</li>
		<li>2015	Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin</li>
		<li>2016	Dark Souls III</li>
		<li>2018	Dark Souls: Remastered</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>  The atmosphere which is created troughout the game is nothing you could describe in words. Just incredible. </p>
		
		
		<p> The series itself is seen in a huge hate-love relationship because it actually requires the ability to adapt and gain perfection. 
		<br>Trust me, many controllers didn´t survive the whole play-trough. </p>

		<p> One slight mistake can end up in the "You Died"-screen which is highly famous for the "Souls"-series and has never changend since the first part.
